## Notes

- **Detailed Interface:** The tip calculator has a clean design with inputs for the bill amount and options to select tip percentage and party size.
- **SeekBar:** A slider allows users to adjust the tip percentage dynamically, with real-time updates to the calculated tip displayed.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Text and color feedback changes based on the selected tip percentage, giving users a qualitative understanding of their tip amount.
- **Language & Framework:** Written in Kotlin, utilizing Android's AppCompatActivity.
- **Layout:** UI components are set up programmatically in the onCreate method, linking XML views to Kotlin variables.
- **Formatting:** Utilizes DecimalFormat to ensure monetary values are displayed in a user-friendly format.
- **Listeners:** Implements listeners for the SeekBar and EditText to recalculate the totals whenever the user changes the input values.
- **Color Feedback:** Uses ContextCompat.getColor to apply color changes to feedback text, providing an immediate visual cue to the user.
- **ArrayAdapter & Spinner:** The app uses these to allow users to select the party size from a predefined list, which is part of the UI layout resources.
